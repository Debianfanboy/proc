# proc

## What is this???

Proc is a package manager built for installing packages that I make or support.
The amount of software in the repo will be limited
This is more of a thing I am making to say I can make it
This is only used to install my software or software I want to gain more exposer

## How do I use it???

Do the following steps to install a package
1. clone the repo
2. run main.py
3. run proc install <The package>
4. enjoy

## Why?

I wanted to build this to reduce the struggle with installing the programs I create
I also made it because it would look nice if I could add this to my resume

## contributing

If you want to contribute then make an issue or add a PR to the repo
